        <p><h1>How Alabama Bled Blue for the First Time in 25 Years</h1></p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="default">
        <p>In an election marred by allegations of sexual abuse by Republican candidate Roy Moore, Democrat Doug Jones pulled off a remarkable upset in the 2017 Senate special election in Alabama, one of the consistently reddest states in the U.S. In his victory speech, Jones seemed as surprised as the rest of the nation was that he had won. Here's how he did it. As you scroll, pay close attention to how the map changes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="trump">
       <p>This is how each county voted in the 2016 presidential election. See how the map became redder? In every single county, Trump had larger margins of victory over Clinton than Moore did over Jones.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="flipflop">
        <p>These are the counties that flip-flopped from the presidential election to the Senate special election. These counties tended to have a critical mass but not a majority of black voters. In counties with an even number of white and black registered voters, energized black voters swung the counties toward Jones' favor.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="metroareasflipflop">
      	<p>Mobile, Tuscaloosa, and Madison stand out as counties with large metropolitan areas. These metro areas were part of a swath of counties with high voter turnout and a low decrease in turnout relative to the 2016 presidential election (turnout decreased by about 25% across the board). </p>
      	
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="allmetro">
      	<p>Jefferson and Montgomery counties were the other two counties with large cities. These counties, totaling 354,463 votes for Jones, made up more than Jones' total alone.</p>
      	
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="allmetro">
      	<p>This map shows how voter turnout decreased since the 2016 election. Darker reds indicate the largest decreases in turnout.</p>
      	
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="metropolitan">
        <p>These counties have voting populations that are at least 40% black, forming a belt around Alabama that makes up the majority of Democratic support in the state. They showed up to the polls in significantly larger numbers than counties with larger white populations.</p>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="metropolitan">
        <p>These counties have voting populations that are at least 80% white. Although counties with significant white majorities mostly voted for Moore, Moore received on average 10 percentage points less than Trump did per county. The allegations were enough to swing some voters to Jones, compel them to vote for a write-in candidate, or make them stay home altogether.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="panel" id="black">
        <p>These counties had populations that were at least 50% Evangelical Christian. Though Moore largely appealed to Evangelicals, they too did not show up to the polls nearly as much as they did for Trump, or as much as black voters did.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="white">
       <p>Out of counties with a majority Evangelical population, Marengo and Clarke County stand out in a lighter shade of red. As it turns out, Marengo and Clarke have significant black populations. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/12/13/there-was-an-enormous-gap-between-black-evangelical-voters-and-white-evangelical-voters-in-alabama/?utm_term=.a39fdbad129b">Black Evangelicals chose to vote along racial rather than religious lines</a>. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel" id="wealthiest">
       <p>While the controversy deterred white voters from coming to the polls at all, it energized black voters across all gender, income, and religious lines. Overwhelmingly, they voted for Jones, forming a bastion of support that made Jones the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat in 25 years. 	 </p>
